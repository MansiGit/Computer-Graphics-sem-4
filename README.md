# Computer-Graphics-sem-4
Computer Graphics (Computer Engineering Pune University, semester 4)
1.	Write C++/Java program to draw line using DDA and Bresenham‘s algorithm. Inherit pixel class and Use function overloading
2.	Write C++/Java program to draw circle using Bresenham‘s algorithm. Inherit pixel class.
3.	Write C++/Java program to draw 2-D object and perform following basic transformations,
    1.	Scaling
    2.	Translation
    3.	Rotation 
    Use operator overloading
4. 
5.	Write C++/Java program to draw inscribed and Circumscribed circles in the triangle as shown as an example below. (Use any Circle drawing and Line drawing algorithms) 
6.	Write C++/Java program for line drawing using DDA or Bresenhams algorithm with patterns such as solid, dotted, dashed, dash dot and thick.
7.	Write C++/Java program to implement Cohen-Sutherland line clipping algorithm for given window. Draw line using mouse interfacing to draw polygon
8.	Write C++/Java program to draw any object such as flower, waves using any curve generation Techniques
9.	Write C++/Java program to implement reflection of2-D object about X axis, Y axis and about  X=Y axis. Also rotate object about arbitrary point given by user
10.	Write C++/Java program to generate Hilbert curve using concept of fractals
11.	Design and simulate any data structure like stack, queue, and trees using graphics. Simulation should include all operations performed on designed data structure. Implement the same using OpenGL.
12.	Write C++/Java program to simulate any one of or similar scene- 
    *	Clock with pendulum
    *	National Flag hoisting
    *	Vehicle/boat locomotion
    *	Water drop falling into the water and generated waves after impact
    *	Kaleidoscope views generation (at least 3 colorful patterns)
